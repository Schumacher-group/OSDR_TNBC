    "**Visualization Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **10k+ samples** show excellent agreement between known and inferred models\n",
    "   - Inferred curves align with data density across neighbourhood range\n",
    "   - Logistic fits capture sigmoid division probability patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Smaller samples (1k-5k)** show more variability:\n",
    "   - Can produce misaligned or reversed fits\n",
    "   - Limited data leads to overfitting or poor generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time point effects**:\n",
    "   - Data closer to steady state (t=1000) provides clearer signal\n",
    "   - Earlier time points have wider neighbourhood distribution but may have noisier signals\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visual validation complements phase portraits**:\n",
    "   - Phase portraits show global dynamics (fixed points, streamlines)\n",
    "   - Fit plots show local accuracy of inferred probability functions\n",
    "   - Both are needed to fully validate OSDR method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: The OSDR method successfully recovers ground truth tissue dynamics when applied to adequately sized samples from simulated data. Visual validation confirms that:\n",
    "- Inferred division probabilities match known model predictions\n",
    "- Logistic regression captures neighbourhood-dependent proliferation patterns\n",
    "- Phase portraits show correct global dynamics with stable central fixed point\n",
    "\n",
    "This validates the OSDR approach for application to real TNBC biopsy data."
